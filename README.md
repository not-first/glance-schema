# Glance Schema
*A JSON schema detailing the [Glance](https://github.com/glanceapp/glance) config file.*

> [!WARNING]
> Currently represents version: v0.8.4. For newer versions of Glance, splitting up the config file is recommended. A schema is unable to function cross-files and cannot be deterministic due to the flexible nature of Glance's `$include`. Reach out if you have any knowledge on how to utilise the benefits of a schema in this environment.

## Usage
For custom usage, the schema link can be found at https://raw.githubusercontent.com/not-first/glance-schema/master/schema.json.

### VS Code
If you use VS Code to edit your `glance.yml`, the schema can be used to provide typing completions, hover descriptions and incorrect configuration errors.

1. Install the [YAML extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=redhat.vscode-yaml).
2. At the top of your `glance.yml` file, add this line:
   ```yaml
   # yaml-language-server: $schema=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/not-first/glance-schema/master/schema.json
   ```
  3. Done.

## Known Limitations
Some error messages can be autogenerated by the schema validator and are unhelpful to figure out what is wrong. These can be customised in the schema once they are located, so please create an issue if you experience one.

## Contribution

Any help in maintaining the schema is appreciated. This may include:
- Adding new widgets
- Updating widget properties as they change
- Updating property descriptions to be more specific/helpful
- Updating property examples
- Adding installation instructions for more environments into this README

### Schema Generation Script
In order to make building the schema easier, it is split into a file per each base property (e.g server, branding, pages) and widgets. A script is then run to build a singular JSON file for the schema.

#### Local Testing
To test locally, install the packages `alive-progress` and `pyyaml` in a python environment and run the script in `scripts/generate-schema.py`. It will generate a `schema.json` at the root of the repo. Then use:
```
yaml-language-server: $schema=file://{PATH_TO_YOUR_SCHEMA.JSON}
```
at the top of any `glance.yml` to test the locally generated version of the schema (in vscode).

Remove this `schema.json` file from your commit if possible, as it is built by a Github Action on push to ensure consistency. A locally generated schema will function the same as one generated automatically.

#### Script Functionality
1. Combines all the top-level properties into the base schema template (branding, pages etc)
2. Loads the widget base properties, creates a specific schema combining this with every widget file
3. Creates a definition for each widget and reference it in the schema
4. Output schema to `schema.json`
