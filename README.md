# Glance Schema
*A JSON schema detailing the [Glance](https://github.com/glanceapp/glance) config file.*

> [!NOTE]
> Currently represents version: v0.8.4. Now supports validation of split config files using [`$include`](https://github.com/glanceapp/glance/blob/main/docs/configuration.md?tab=readme-ov-file#including-other-config-files)!

## Usage
The schema is available at: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/not-first/glance-schema/master/schema.json`

### Main Config File (glance.yml)

For your main `glance.yml` configuration file:

1. Install the [YAML extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=redhat.vscode-yaml) for VS Code.
2. At the top of your `glance.yml` file, add this line:
   ```yaml
   # yaml-language-server: $schema=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/not-first/glance-schema/master/schema.json
   ```
3. Done! You'll now get typing completions, hover descriptions, and validation errors.

### Split Config Files

The schema now supports validating split config files using the `$include` directive. Here are examples for common use cases:

#### Widget Files

For files containing widgets (e.g., `widgets/tailscale.yml`, `widgets/rss.yml`):

```yaml
# yaml-language-server: $schema=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/not-first/glance-schema/master/schema.json#/definitions/widget

- type: rss
  title: News
  feeds:
    - url: ${RSS_URL}
```

#### Page Files

For files containing pages (e.g., `pages/home.yml`, `pages/dashboard.yml`):

```yaml
# yaml-language-server: $schema=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/not-first/glance-schema/master/schema.json#/definitions/page

- name: Home
  columns:
    - size: full
      widgets:
        - type: rss
          title: News
```

### Automatic Schema Application for Folders

For projects with dedicated folders for widgets and pages, you can configure VS Code to automatically apply the appropriate schema without adding comments to each file.

Add this to your `.vscode/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "yaml.schemas": {
    "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/not-first/glance-schema/master/schema.json": ["glance.yml"],
    "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/not-first/glance-schema/master/schema.json#/definitions/widget": ["widgets/*.yml"],
    "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/not-first/glance-schema/master/schema.json#/definitions/page": ["pages/*.yml"]
  }
}
```

This configuration:
- Applies the main schema to `glance.yml`
- Applies the widget schema to all `.yml` files in the `widgets/` folder
- Applies the page schema to all `.yml` files in the `pages/` folder


## Known Limitations
Some error messages can be autogenerated by the schema validator and are unhelpful in figuring out what is wrong. These can be customised in the schema once they are located, so please create an issue if you experience one.
