# Glance Schema
*A JSON schema detailing the [Glance](https://github.com/glanceapp/glance) config file.*

> [!WARNING]
> Currently represents version: v0.8.4. For newer versions of Glance, splitting up large config files using [`$include`](https://github.com/glanceapp/glance/blob/main/docs/configuration.md?tab=readme-ov-file#including-other-config-files) is recommended. This schema cannot currently work to validate split config files, but support is planned.

## Usage
For custom usage, the schema link can be found at https://raw.githubusercontent.com/not-first/glance-schema/master/schema.json.

### VS Code
If you use VS Code to edit your `glance.yml`, the schema can be used to provide typing completions, hover descriptions and incorrect configuration errors.

1. Install the [YAML extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=redhat.vscode-yaml).
2. At the top of your `glance.yml` file, add this line:
   ```yaml
   # yaml-language-server: $schema=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/not-first/glance-schema/master/schema.json
   ```
  3. Done.

## Known Limitations
Some error messages can be autogenerated by the schema validator and are unhelpful in figuring out what is wrong. These can be customised in the schema once they are located, so please create an issue if you experience one.
